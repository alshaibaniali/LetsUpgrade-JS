<!--
The different datatypes in JavaScript:
1-Numbers
2-Bigint
3-string
4-boolean
5-null
6-undefined

1-Numbers:

The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.

Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity,

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:-->

Example:
var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals

<!--

2-string:
A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".
Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes-->
Ex:

var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";   // Using double quotes
var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';   // Using single quotes

<!--

4-boolean
Booleans can only have two values: true or false. -->

Ex:
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = 6;
(x == y)       // Returns true
(x == z)       // Returns false

<!--

5-Undefined
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined. -->

Ex:
var car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined

<!---
6-Empty Values:
An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.

An empty string has both a legal value and a type.  -->

Ex:
var car = "";    // The value is "", the typeof is "string"


<!--
7-Null

In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.

Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object. -->

Ex:
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
person = null;    // Now value is null, but type is still an object
